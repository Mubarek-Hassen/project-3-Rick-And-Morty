## Description
- As a fan of The Rick and Morty show and characters, building web app that is related to the show was more of fun than work. The vast universe of the show makes us wonder how would we deal if the silly encounters the characters face are real in our world as well. The side characters also have their own story that we get to see in a small amount but could be expanded. Hence, this app is for those who would like to know about the characters and enjoy the show.
